Brief Description of the assignment: The purpose of this assignment is to implement a Graph ADT and associated algorithms in C. 
This project will utilize the List ADT from PA2 by adding new features such as a BFS algorithm with the Graph. 


Files Submitted:
1) List.c : This module will be a bi-directional queue that includes a “cursor” to be used for iteration between the elements in the list. Explicit algorithm of every f-n from List.h
2) List.h : Header file for List.c. Module with all List functions in implicit form
3) Graph.c : The module creates a Graph using the BFS algorithm. Represented as an array of Lists
4) Graph.h : Header file for Graph.c. Module with all List functions in implicit form
5) GraphTest.c : Test file for the Graph ADT
6) FindPath.c : Client program for Graph.h
5) Makefile: file that creates an executable jar file called FindPath. Unchanged 
6) README: Current file. Brief details about the project and its creator. Edited by the programmer

UPD: The application was checked for memory leaks, none detected.
