Brief Description of the assignment: The purpose of this assignment is to implement a Graph module in C that implements Depth First Search (DFS). 
This project will use Graph module to find the strongly connected components of a directed graph. 


Files Submitted:
1) List.c : This module will be a bi-directional queue that includes a “cursor” to be used for iteration between the elements in the list. Explicit algorithm of every f-n from List.h
2) List.h : Header file for List.c. Module with all List functions in implicit form
3) Graph.c : The module creates a Graph using the DFS algorithm. Modified for PA5 in order to implement DFS
4) Graph.h : Header file for Graph.c. Module with all functions in implicit form. Modified for PA5 in order to implement DFS
5) GraphTest.c : Test file for the Graph ADT
6) FindComponents.c : Client program for Graph.h
5) Makefile: file that creates an executable jar file called FindComponents. Provided in the examples folder by the professor 
6) README: Current file. Brief details about the project and its creator. Edited by the programmer

UPD: The application was checked for memory leaks, none detected.
